# Genric-library-of-C-
I have created a genric library of C language in which you can perform various data structures generically with any type of datatypes you want. At this point of time i have given the implementation of Stacks ,Queues, SinglyLinkedList, AVLTree. Soon i will update it with remaining data structures. Hope you like it.
